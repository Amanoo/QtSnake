# QtSnake

Made for an embedded project. Non-functional register shenanigans and weird pointer stuff exists facilitate the easy creation of a port to the intended embedded system (at which point the Qt elements will be abandoned) and comply with the embedded system's standards. Built in Qt Creator.
